# bivariate-maps-qgis
The idea of this work was based on the excellent work of Timo Grossenbacher, https://timogrossenbacher.ch/2019/04/bivariate-maps-with-ggplot2-and-sf/ which has initially created these maps with R. I played and tested a lot of time with these R code and was amazed about it. 

Some days ago I showed the maps to a friend of me which work in the GIS area. We played in the past a lot with gis systems, he with his ESRI Arcgis and I with QGIS. He had the opinion that this would be easy possible with a GIS system as well. I was in the following strong motivated to figure out if this is possible. Yes it is and I am very lucky that it is possible as well.
